"""Proposer-confirmer loop: the agentic edge over the deterministic core.

This is where the North Star's P6 reasoning layer lives, built so that the LLM's
creativity is fully contained:

    recon context
        -> Strategist (LLM PROPOSES ranked tests)        [probabilistic]
        -> TargetGuard + StateChangeGuard (SAFETY)        [deterministic, hard]
        -> deterministic executor runs the test           [deterministic]
        -> judge confirms (your existing confirmation)    [deterministic]
        -> confirmed findings feed back into recon        [the loop]

The loop NEVER lets the LLM:
- choose a host or send a request (executor + guards own that),
- decide what is a confirmed finding (the judge owns that),
- escalate intensity past the safe clamp (strategist owns that).

The executor and judge are injected as callables so this module stays decoupled
and unit-testable. In production they are wired to the real ExecutionEngine and
confirmation pipeline; in tests they are deterministic fakes.
