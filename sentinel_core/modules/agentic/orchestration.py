"""High-level agentic orchestration: graph -> strategist -> proposer-confirmer.

This is the single entry point the rest of the platform calls to run the
agentic reasoning layer over a set of endpoints. It:

1. builds/loads the :class:`KnowledgeGraph` recon model,
2. runs the bounded proposer-confirmer loop with the real safety guards,
3. returns confirmed findings plus the updated graph for persistence.

It is gated by ``AGENTIC_LLM_ENABLED``: when off (the default), it returns an
empty, well-formed result without calling any model, so callers can invoke it
unconditionally and the platform behaves exactly as before until an operator
opts in.
