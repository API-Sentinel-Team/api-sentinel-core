"""Shared risk memory between Testing and Runtime Detection.

This closes the pipeline gap where the DAST scanner and the runtime detector were
two separate brains. When a scan confirms a vulnerability on an endpoint, we lift
that endpoint's ``risk_score`` (and stamp ``last_tested``). Runtime detection then
reads that score (see ``endpoint_risk_multiplier``) to weight live-traffic risk
toward endpoints we have *proven* are vulnerable.

Deterministic and pure-ish: the only side effect is updating the APIEndpoint row.
Severity maps to a confirmed-vulnerability risk floor; multiple confirmed vulns
push the score up but never past 1.0.
